## üíª Skills

I have developed a strong skill set in various programming languages and technologies, which enables me to create versatile and high-quality projects. Some of the key skills I possess are:

**Python**: As a versatile language, Python is my go-to choice for implementing machine learning algorithms, creating game prototypes, and scripting various game logic components.

**C++**: With its robust and powerful capabilities, C++ is a crucial tool in my arsenal for developing high-performance games and handling complex game engine tasks.

**Node.js**: This runtime environment allows me to efficiently build scalable and high-performance server-side applications, utilizing JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development.

**HTML**: As a fundamental building block of the web, my skills in HTML allow me to create engaging and interactive web-based experiences for showcasing my projects and sharing my passion for game design and machine learning.

In addition to these core skills, I am also proficient in other technologies, such as JavaScript, CSS, and various game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine. I am always eager to learn new skills and keep up with the latest industry trends to ensure that my projects are always on the cutting edge.
